      <h2>Who is the "Forest Man of India"?</h2>
      <p>
        Jadav "Molai" Payeng (born 1963) is an environmental activist and forestry
        worker from Majuli, popularly known as the Forest Man of India. Over the course of
        several decades, he has planted and tended trees on a sandbar of the river
        Brahmaputra turning it into a forest reserve. The forest, called Molai forest after
        him, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat, Assam, India and encompasses an area of
        about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the
        fourth highest civilian award in India. He was born in the indigenous Mising tribe
        of Assam.

      <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
      <p>
        In 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to
        excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he
        planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar. He started working on the forest
        in 1979 when the social forestry division of Golaghat district launched a scheme of
        tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5 km from
        Kokilamukh in Jorhat district. Molai was one of the labourers who worked in that project
        which was completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the
        project even after other workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued
        to plant more trees on his own, in an effort to transform the area into a forest.
